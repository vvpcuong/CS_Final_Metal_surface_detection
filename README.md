GC10-DET is the surface defect dataset collected in a real industry. It contains ten types of surface defects, i.e:

- Punching (Pu): 219 images.
- Weld line (Wl): 273 images.
- Crescent gap (Cg): 226 images.
- Water spot (Ws): 289 images.
- Oil spot (Os): 204 images.
- Silk spot (Ss): 650 images.
- Inclusion (In): 216 images.
- Rolled pit (Rp): 31 images.
- Crease (Cr): 52 images.
- Waist folding (Wf): 146 images.

The collected defects are on the surface of the steel sheet. The dataset includes 2280 gray-scale images and its label for type of defect and the true bounding box.
